# Football Analysis & Visualizations

Football has always been one of my biggest passions, and so has coding. With data analysis becoming a central pillar in modern football, this repository represents the intersection of both interests.

Here, I explore the game through Python-based analytics, creating visualizations that help break down player performance, team styles, and tactical trends. The repo will be general-purpose and will include:

- 📊 **Graphs and charts** analyzing players, teams, and specific metrics  
- 🔍 **Comparative visualizations** between players, clubs, and competitions  
- 🧪 **Jupyter notebooks** demonstrating the full analysis pipeline  
- 🕸️ **Web scraping scripts** for collecting real-world football data before visualization

This is an ongoing project where I experiment, learn, and refine my approach to football analytics. More datasets, insights, and visualizations will be added over time.

Other focused projects will have a standalone repo.

Feel free to explore, clone, and build on the work, and enjoy diving into football through the lens of data.
