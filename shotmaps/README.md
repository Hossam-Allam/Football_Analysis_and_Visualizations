# Shotmaps

This folder contains visualizations and analysis focused on **shot maps** — one of the most informative tools in modern football analytics. Shot maps reveal where players and teams are taking their chances, how efficiently they convert them, and how their shooting patterns compare across matches or seasons.

### What’s Included

- 📌 **Shot map visualizations** for individual players and teams
- 📊 **Summary shooting statistics** (goals, xG, shot locations, conversion rates, etc.)
- 🔄 **Comparative shot maps** between players, teams, or match performances

These shot maps aim to provide a clearer view of attacking trends, shooting efficiency, and tactical patterns that influence match outcomes.

More visualizations and comparisons will be added as the project expands.
